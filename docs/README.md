## OctoAcme Project Management Processes: Summary

OctoAcme's approach emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and a culture of feedback and learning. Our framework is designed to support cross-functional teams with clearly defined roles—Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, and QA—working together through a structured lifecycle from initiation to retrospective. Each phase is supported by documented processes, standardized artifacts, and consistent communication cadences that enable transparency and alignment across all stakeholders.

Our key workflows follow a proven lifecycle: initiation establishes the problem statement and stakeholders; planning breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria; execution uses daily standups, project boards, and pull request workflows to track progress; and release processes ensure safe, well-tested deployments. Throughout each phase, teams maintain risk registers, conduct regular demos, and track metrics to ensure data-informed decision-making. All projects culminate in retrospectives that capture learnings and drive continuous improvement.

The personas and roles defined in our process emphasize clear responsibilities and collaboration patterns. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk management while maintaining stakeholder communication. Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success through customer and business value metrics. Developers implement features with a focus on quality, test coverage, and maintainability, while QA validates acceptance criteria and quality standards. This role clarity, combined with our documented communication strategies—from weekly syncs to monthly stakeholder updates—ensures projects stay aligned and on track.

Our quality assurance practices are embedded throughout the project lifecycle. Teams define a "Definition of Done" during planning, implement unit and integration tests during execution, run automated security scanning in CI, and conduct end-to-end testing before releases. Retrospectives provide a structured forum to review what worked well and identify improvement opportunities, creating a feedback loop that continuously strengthens our processes and outcomes.
